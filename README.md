- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas
- 👀 I’m interested in Electrical Engineering, the entire concept of fixing problems and creating new ways to do things gets me excited.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Electronics Engineering in New Zealand, currently learning C as our foundation in coding.
- 💞️ I’m open to any collaboration but keep in mind I'm not all that experienced currently!
